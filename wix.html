<!--
 This overlay will cover the whole screen with a spinner to mask the dummy content. Make sure you insert this at the top of the page.
 Your script will run and detect if it is Twitterbot.
 If it's a human, it will instantly redirect to your main Shopify website through a masked link (in case they start scanning the page for a marker).
 If it's a bot, the overlay will instantly disappear and show the dummy content that looks like a real Wix or Wordpress blog.

	<div class="spinner"></div>
</div>
<!-- This is the rest of your page -->
<div>
	Insert a bunch of spun content for the bot to read, but will be hidden from human view by the overlay...
	For example, if you make a Wix website, you would just fill the pages with your cheap spun text and some random images from Unsplash etc.
	The key is to make this "look" like a real site to the bots, but not have to spend a long time making each site.
